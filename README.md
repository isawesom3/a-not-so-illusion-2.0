# an illusion 2.0

notice:  
worked really hard on this hope u enjoy(there are exactly 4,100 lines of the CODE!!!!!!!!!) AND its only python TURTLE

### all made from basic python TURTLE

### what it does!
what it does is basicly makes a triangle OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER angain in every different color i could think of in anot-so illusion-y way BUT! (ya knew there was gonna be a butt) this triangle loop illusion thingamabob-y thing thingy is something i worked REALLY REALLY REALLY hard on so enjoy using it.
### how to get
so.. to get it theres no link or download thing or any website or ANYTHING you can see it on, so i guess you can just go ahead and copy the code in my .py file and paste it into some python turtle IDE or IDLE (still dont know whatits called)


## a picture and stuff
see it now!(⤵)
