# an illusion 2.0

notice:  
worked really hard on this hope u enjoy(there are exactly 4,100 lines of the CODE!!!!!!!!!) AND its only python TURTLE



### what it does!
what it does is basicly makes a triangle OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER angain in every different color i could think of in anot-so illusion-y way BUT! (ya knew there was gonna be a butt) this triangle loop illusion thingamabob-y thing thingy is something i worked REALLY REALLY REALLY hard on so enjoy using it.
### how to get
so.. to get it theres no link or download thing or any website or ANYTHING you can see it on, so i guess you can just go ahead and copy the code in my .py file and paste it into some python turtle IDE or IDLE (still dont know whatits called)



#### bonus section 
here are some of the colors i used   
(Black Grey Red Blue Orange White Brown Pink Yellow Green Purple Maroon Turquoise Cyan Navy blue Gold Tomato Teal Lime Cyan Wheat Salmon Olive Aqua Violet Chocolate Azure Sİlver Bronze Dark blue Navy and etc…)
